<p align="center">We welcome you to the website for the Ministry of Magic on the Final Fantasy XIV Excalibur server. <br>
Our FC was originally founded in roughly Feburary of 2017, and we purchased our first FC house only a little later.<br>
Since then we have lived through the Stormblood expansion, and are going into Shadowbringers with a strong community.<br>
We now have a Mansion in Shirogane, a fully decked fleet of Airships & Submersibles, a very active discord, and over 50 members.</p>
